        <h2 id="aperitif">Understanding aperitif wines</h2>

        <p>To understand vermouth, one first must understand aperitif wines. Aperitif derives from the Latin aperire, which is the verb “to open,” in the sense of opening up the appetite. All true aperitifs carry a bittersweet character that stimulates the production of gastric juices and promotes appetite.</p>

        <p>Aperitif wines are aromatized wines. Aromatized means that the wine has been flavored with <a href="botanicals.html">botanicals that add flavor and color</a>. The aperitif wine category includes all vermouths, quinquinas, americanos, and a smattering of other proprietary formula wine products.</p>

        <p>Vermouth, quinquina and americano are also fortified wines. Fortified means the alcohol percentage of the wine has been raised through the addition of spirits. Almost all these wines have a white wine or mistelle base. All but a small number of red/dark/opaque aperitif wines achieve their coloration through other ingredients rather than the wine itself, namely caramel color (burnt sugar).</p>

        <p>Other kinds of wines are also fortified, including famous examples sherry, madeira, port and marsala, but these aren’t aromatized, and aren’t really aperitif wines.</p>

        <h2 id="vermouth">Vermouth</h2>

        <p>The word “vermouth” derives from “wormwood”, and is inherited from earlier Hungarian and German wormwood-infused wines of the same name. At least since the early 19th Century, what we mean by “vermouth” is a refinement incorporating the most desirable elements of both these older wines and various other traditions: a moderately sweet, herbaceous, compounded beverage. Wormwood remains vermouth’s starting point: its principal, defining botanical. Some none-wormwood based ‘vermouth’ have appeared recently. Although they may be legally called vermouth on certain markets, they do not belong to the vermouth tradition and will not be covered here.</p>

        <p>Geographically, the cradle of vermouth is the ethnically Italian Piemonte and the ethnically French Savoy regions, which, in the 18th Century comprised the mainland territory of the Kingdom of Sardinia. In addition to political and economic ties, these regions shared the local wine production, wealth, and the rich botanical diversity of the Alpine foothills necessary to produce vermouth and related beverages. (By 1861, the Kingdom of Sardinia had gobbled up the rest of the peninsula to create what we know today as Italy, losing the Savoy region permanently to France by treaty.)</p>

        <p>The aperitif wines of this area brought together various traditions and trends. First, the ancient trade in folk medicines and tonics, in which wormwood, with its digestive properties, was a key ingredient. Second, the luxurious spiced wines served at European courts — the status drink of their time. Third, the discovery that wines fortified with spirits travelled better and thus could be sold long distance. The flavoring of local wines made them more commercially valuable. These wines are delicious and packed with “medicinal” botanicals (now enjoyed for their flavors and appetite-enhancing effects rather than as cures).</p>

For a cross-cultural survey of medicinal botanicals and recipes for alcoholic folk remedies, see Stephen Buhner’s “Sacred and Herbal Healing Beers” (Siris Books, 1998).]</p>

        <p>Large scale commercial aperitif production emerged in the mid-1800s with a focus on craft and consistency and an eye toward export markets. The major ports of  Marseilles, Genoa and Venice played key roles for the importation of exotic botanicals (spice trade) and the export of product to new markets, especially the Americas. Traditionally, these products were named for the entrepreneurs that created them. Today, several of these names are amongst the greatest brands in this history of spirits.</p>

     <h2 id="styles">Styles of vermouth</h2>

        <p>The vermouth style first developed in Piemonte from the late 18th century was sweet and bitter. The French style, invented in Lyon by Louis Noilly at the turn of the 19th century was by contrast dry and less bitter. A third style emerged in Chambéry around 1820. As sweet as Piemontese vermouth, it was markedly less bitter. It would end up giving brith to blanc / bianco vermouth. A footnote—but one of growing significance in the marketplace—is Spanish vermouth. Their vermouths, largely comparable to sweet, red Italian vermouth, tend to have a less Alpine and more Mediterranean character.</p>

        <p class="gray">[link to the birth of Italian vermouth — ie debunking the Carpano myth]<br />

        [link to the history of Chambéry vermouth]<br />
        [link to the birth of Spanish vermouth]</p>

        <p>These same regions have historically produced other styles of vermouth in the past, not all of which have achieved international success. Two examples that have—both from Torino—are vermouth alla vaniglia (vermouth with vanilla) and vermouth con bitter (vermouth with extra bitters). Those drinks were invented in the cafés of Torino and are in a way early examples of ready-to-drink. Some, such as Vermouth Chinato (vermouth with added quinine) or Vermouth Amaro (extra-bitter vermouth) are making a timid 21st Century comeback. </p>

        <p>Originally, though, vermouth brands were established around a singular product. The notion of “Italian vermouth” and “French vermouth” arose as the export market exploded. None of these products were labeled “Italian vermouth” or “French vermouth”, but their Italian or French origin was the second-most obvious thing about them after the brand name. At this point, color was not a major marketing factor — most vermouths where of similar amber color. ‘Blanc’ (white) vermouth was only developed by Comoz in Chambéry in 1881 and red vermouth did not become  ‘red’ until the 1910s.</p>

        <p>With commercial expansion in the late 19th century and rising awareness of the competition, French producers imitated Italian producers and vice-versa, in the hope of capturing market shares. Today, almost all traditional vermouth producers manufacture some form of red (Italian-style) and dry (French-style) vermouths, and many also produce a white vermouth. It is generally fair to say that French producers are more esteemed for the lighter, dry vermouths, and Italian producers are more esteemed for the red, spicy Torino-inspired vermouths, but all commercial vermouths are proprietary formulas, and it is their unique botanicals and flavor profiles that distinguish them. Some may be better, some lesser, although even those often judged amongst the “best” may not be best in all circumstances. It is particularly important to not fall into the trap of comparing vermouths to some platonic ideal: it’s no more reasonable to expect all vermouths of one style to taste the same than it is to expect all bourbons or gins to taste the same. Celebrate the diversity of choice and let your own taste be your guide.</p>
